<li>Trifocal Lense</strong>
<p> - made up of three lenses to correct not only near and far distance vision, but also presbyopia, the inability to focus in the middle distance.
 They have an additional power to correct intermediate vision. The intermediate portion may be used to view a computer screen, for example.

<p>
<font size=4 font color = black face=arial>

<p>
In <strong> EYESAVER</strong> the screw is also used to adjust the vision of the lenses depending on how blur or how clear you need.
