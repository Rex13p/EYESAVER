                                <p>Eyeglasses are the most common form of eyewear used to correct or improve many types of vision problems. They consist of a frame that holds 2 pieces of glass or plastic, which have been ground into lenses to correct refractive errors. They are vision eyewear, consisting of glass or hard plastic lenses mounted in a frame that holds them in front of a person's eyes, typically utilizing a bridge over the nose and hinged arms (known as temples or temple pieces) which rest over the ears. Glasses are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading glasses and glasses used for nearsightedness, however, without the specialized lenses, they are sometimes used for cosmetic purposes.
