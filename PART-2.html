- They are the round plastic pieces under the bridge that sit on your nose. They give your glasses a more comfortable and secure fit.
Depending on what style of frame front you have, there are various types of nose pads for glasses frames. These can either part of the frame front material or as a separate metal piece called a pad arm.

<p>
- It is the center of the frame that rests on your nose and joins the two rims together.
It bridges the two lenses over your nose and holds most of the weight of your glasses. It’s a determining factor for how well the glasses will fit your face. For full-rim frames, the bridge forms part of the frame front. For half-rim or rimless frames, an extra piece is required. Bridges vary by style to suit different face shapes.

<p>
- They give the glasses form and character and hold the lenses in place. They can be thick or thin, simple or elaborate, understated or eye-catching, and any color imaginable. Some glasses are rimless, which means they lack a frame front and have a minimalist, barely-there appeal. On rimless frames, the bridge and temples connect directly to the lenses.
They lend form and character to your eyeglasses—they also provide function by holding the lenses in place.
